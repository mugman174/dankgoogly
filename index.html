            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I'm <a href="https://github.com/DanKGooGLy/DanKGooGLy">DanK</a>.
                I'm a Canadian developer working on many small projects, such as
                <a href="https://github.com/DanKGooGLy/w1spy">w1spy</a>, a
                rather joke-like project.<br />
                <br />I'm also the owner of the
                <a href="https://github.com/Catvibers">Catvibers</a>
                organization, which is mainly a bunch of inexperienced devs
                working on random projects together.<br />
                <br />A couple of the projects I've worked on are:
                <a href="https://github.com/DanKGooGLy/aquarium">Aquarium</a>, a
                <a href="https://fishshell.com/">Fish Shell</a> prompt that
                mimics the look of the Windows CMD prompt.<br />
                <br />I've also worked on
                <a href="https://github.com/DanKGooGLy/p0six">p0six</a>, a
                collection of shell scripts (Mostly posix), as well as
                <a href="https://github.com/DanKGooGLy/t3xtures">t3xtures</a>, a
                Minecraft 1.8 PvP-Oriented texture pack.<br />
                <br />And the last project I'm working on is
                <a href="//genericlinux.org/">Generic Linux</a>, which is a
                distribution of Linux that's meant to comply with practically
                all UNIX standards whilst being ironically generic.<br />
                <br />
